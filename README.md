# DevOps Course

Labs and exercises to help you learn DevOps practices.

# Set Up Docker and Git

We'll use lots of tools in the course and they each have their own dependencies and configuration. To simplify we'll use Docker containers to run all the components, so you don't need to install a ton of software.

> You don't need any Docker experience for this course, everything will be scripted out for you.

# Automation with Jenkins

[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) is an open source automation server which enables developers around the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software.It is probably the most popular automation server around. It's been around a long time and one of the main features is its extensibility: it has a plugin framework with over [1800 published plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io) which you can use to build any type of application, or integrate with any third-party system. There's a web UI you can use to define jobs, which get stored on the server's filesystem.

The plugin based architecture enables Jenkins to work with any type of application but that is also one of the reasons because of which many people don't like Jenkins. Plugins are prone to security flaws so they need frequent updates, but they can be fiddly to automate. We'll use Jenkins in a different way, with minimal plugins and job definitions stored in source control.

# Part 1

## Running Jenkins

Start by running Jenkins inside a Docker container, this is the official jenkins image:

```
docker-compose -f labs/jenkins/infra/docker-compose.yml up
```

Browse http://localhost:8080 and follow the installation wizard.

You need to configure it with a default password stored inside the container file system. To fetch the default admin password:

```
docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Next screen will ask to customize Jenkins

<img src="../../img/jenkins-customize.png" width="500"/>

<br>Next it will ask to install the plugins, select the "none" option at the top (see image)

<img src="../../img/jenkins-plugin-installation.png" width="500"/>

In the final step it Jenkins will ask to create the first admin user:

- username: `devops`
- password: `devops`

Check out the UI. The left nav takes you to the main options, including the menu to manage Jenkins; the central section will show a list of jobs once you have created some. 

## Creating a Freestyle Job

We'll create a classic Jenkins job - using the freestyle type where you build up the steps using the web UI:

- click _Create a job_ on the home screen
- call the new job `lab-1`
- set the job type to be _Freestyle project_
- click _OK_

This creates the new job. There are different sections of the UI which represent typical stages of a build - source code connection details, the build triggers and the build steps.

We'll use this job to run a simple script which prints some text:

- scroll down to the _Build_ section
- click _Add build step_
- select _Execute shell_
- paste this into the _Command_ box:

```
echo "This is build number: $BUILD_NUMBER of job: $JOB_NAME"
```

- click _Save_

> Jenkins populates [a set of environment variables](http://localhost:8080/env-vars.html/) when it runs the job, which are accessible in the job steps. This script prints out the build number - which is an incrementing count of the number of times the job has run - and the job name.

Now you're in the main job window. The left nav lets you configure the job again, and the central section will show the recent runs of the job.

Click _Build Now_ to run the job. When the build finishes check the output in http://localhost:8080/job/lab-1/1/console

ðŸ“‹ Build the job again - how is the output different?

<details>
  <summary>Not sure?</summary>

Click _Build Now_ again. When the job completes you can see the output at http://localhost:8080/job/lab-1/2/console

The job name is the same, but the number has incremented.

</details><br/>

## Cleanup

Cleanup by removing all containers:

```
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
```

# Part 2

## Using the packaged Jenkins container


Start by running Jenkins inside a Docker container, along with a local Git server (using Gogs):

```
docker-compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

> This is a custom setup of Jenkins with a few plugins already installed.

Browse to Jenkins at http://localhost:8080. You may see a page saying "Jenkins is getting ready to work" - it can take a few minutes for a new server to come online. When you see the home page, click the log in link and sign in with these admin credentials:

- username: `thecodecamp`
- password: `student`


******************************************************

There are other tools installed in this Jenkins server, which you would use in a real pipeline. What happens if you print the version of the Java compiler, the Docker command line or the Kubernetes command line in the script?


ðŸ“‹ We'll create a new classic Jenkins job - using the freestyle type. The job will print the version numbers of `javac`, `docker` and `kubectl`.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

- click _Create a job_ on the home screen
- call the new job `lab-2`
- set the job type to be _Freestyle project_
- click _OK_

This creates the new job. There are different sections of the UI which represent typical stages of a build - source code connection details, the build triggers and the build steps.

We'll use this job to run a simple script which prints some text:

- scroll down to the _Build_ section
- click _Add build step_
- select _Execute shell_
- paste this into the _Command_ box:

```
docker version

javac --version

kubectl version
```

Click _Save_.

</details><br/>

When you build the new job, it will fail. Shell commands always return with an exit code, usually 0 means OK and non-zero means the command failed. The Kubernetes CLI errors because it can't connect to a Kubernetes environment. The exit code is non-zero so Jenkins takes that as a failure so the job step fails. 

If there were other steps after this one, they wouldn't run because the job exits when a step fails.

> This is the old-school way of using Jenkins. Where does the job definition live? How would you migrate it to a new Jenkins server? The better option is to use [pipelines](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/), which use plugins that are already installed on this server.

## Pipelines and the Blue Ocean UI

The pipeline feature comes with the `workflow-aggregator` and `blueocean` plugins. Those give you the new way of defining and managing jobs, where the job definition is stored in source control.

Browse to the Jenkins homepage and select _Open Blue Ocean_ from the left nav. You'll see your original build job - click to open it in the new UI, where you can start a new build and view the logs.

We'll create a new pipeline job instead. Browse back to main Blue Ocean UI at http://localhost:8080/blue and click _New pipeline_.

ðŸ“‹ Set up the new pipeline to connect to your Git server, running at http://gogs:3000/thecodecamp/demo.git - it uses the same credentials as Jenkins.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

- Select _Git_ in the source code list (not _GitHub_! we're using our own Git server)

- Set the _Repository URL_ to http://gogs:3000/thecodecamp/demo.git 

- Set _Username_ to `thecodecamp` and _Password_ to `student`

- Click _Create Credential_ - the login details are stored in Jenkins

- Click _Create Pipeline_

- Click _Create Pipeline_ again :)

</details><br/>

> The Jenkins container is on the same Docker network as the Gogs container, so it can access it using the DNS name `gogs`. 

Your new pipeline starts empty. Click the plus icon `+` in the pipeline visualizer to add a new stage. Call the stage `audit`. Then click _Add step_ to add a step to the stage:

- Select _Shell Script_ as the step type

- Paste this into the script text box:

```
echo "This is build number: $BUILD_NUMBER of job: $JOB_NAME"

javac --version
```

> The UI may not preserve the line spaces correctly, you can ignore that.

Click _Save_ and then _Save & run_. Jenkins creates the pipeline definition and uploads it to the Git server. Wait a moment and the build will automatically start. The build should succeed - check the output to see the message.

ðŸ“‹ Browse to your Git repo at http://localhost:3000/thecodecamp/demo - where is the build definition stored?

<details>
  <summary>Not sure?</summary>

There's a single file in the repo called `Jenkinsfile`. Open it and you'll see the pipeline definition, with the stage called `audit` containing the shell script to print version numbers.

</details><br/>

The UI to build a pipeline is useful, but typically you'll create the Jenkinsfile in your source repo and edit the text directly when you change the pipeline. 

## Storing Pipelines in Source Code

We'll use [this Jenkinsfile](./manual-gate/Jenkinsfile) for our next build. It has multiple stages but it should be fairly clear what it's doing. An interesting point is the _Deploy_ stage which used an `input` block to ask a user for confirmation.

To run the pipeline, first we'll push the `devops` repo to our local Git server so Jenkins can use it.

Open Gogs at http://localhost:3000 and sign in with username `thecodecamp` and password `student`. Under the _My Repositories_ section you'll see the `demo` repository; click the plus icon to create a new repo:

- set _Repository Name_ to `devops`

- set visibility to `Private` 

- leave all other options with the defaults

- click _Create Repository_

Now you can add your local Gogs server as a remote for the course repo, and push the contents:

```
git remote add gogs http://localhost:3000/thecodecamp/devops.git

git push gogs master
```

> You'll need to log in with your Git client - use the usual credentials.

Check the repo at http://localhost:3000/thecodecamp/devops, and you'll see all the lab content. This is like your own private GitHub.

Browse back to Jenkins at http://localhost:8080/view/all/newJob to create a new job:

- call it `manual-gate`

- select _Pipeline_ as the job type

- click _OK_

This is the classic UI - you can still use it to work with new pipelines. Scroll to the _Pipeline_ section:

- select _Pipeline script from SCM_ in the dropdown
- set the SCM to _Git_
- set the _Repository URL_ to `http://gogs:3000/thecodecamp/devops.git`
- set the _Script Path_ to `labs/jenkins/manual-gate/Jenkinsfile`

Save and run the build. It will pause after the _Test_ stage and wait for user input.

ðŸ“‹ In the job UI is it clear how you can progress the _Deploy_ stage and complete the build?

<details>
  <summary>Not sure?</summary>

You'll see boxes representing each stage of the pipeline - earlier stages are green to show they've suceeded. The _Deploy_ box is blue and it says _Paused_:

![](/img/jenkins-manual-gate.png)

Click the blue box and you'll see the confirmation window with the options defined in the Jenkinsfile. Click _Do it!_ and the build will continue.

</details><br/>

Input blocks are very useful as you can automate the full deployment in the pipeline, but still have manual approval for different stages.

## Lab

Now it's your turn :) There's another pipeline defined in this repo which builds and runs a simple Java app. The [Jenkinsfile](hello-world/Jenkinsfile) is at `labs/jenkins/hello-world/Jenkinsfile`:

- create a new job to run that pipeline
- include a build trigger to poll SCM for changes every minute
- the build will fail :) You'll need to update the Jenkinsfile and push changes to your Gogs server to fix it
- when you get the build running, where can you find the compiled binaries?

Use these commands to push your updated Jenkinsfile:

```
git add labs/jenkins/hello-world/Jenkinsfile
git commit -m 'Lab solution'
git push gogs
```
